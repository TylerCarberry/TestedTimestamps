This Is Only A Test - Timestamp Bot
Automatically generates timestamps by listening for the transition music
Made by Tyler Carberry, tyler.carberry@gmail.com

Segments
• Intro/dubstep intro
• Top story
• Pop culture news
• Technology news
• Pinball
• Vr minute
• Moment of science
• Things that annoy me
• Outro


Adding new segments:
• Just email me the transition music for the new segment and I'll add it in

Notes:
• Every so often it misses a segment. This is because the program takes random samples
  of audio snippets and sometimes none of these points fall during a transition. Running the
  program again usually fixes it.
• The program assumes that each segment happens once. If you have 2 VR Minutes one week
  then one of the timestamps will be lost
